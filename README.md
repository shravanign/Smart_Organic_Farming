# Smart_Organic_Farming
In this project we have three stakeholders:
1. NGOs(experts)
2. Farmers
3. Consumers                                                                                                                    
who form a community.

The problem faced by the consumer is that he is unaware whether the food he eats is purely organic or not. The problem faced by 
the farmer are:
1. He does not know where to sell his agricultural produce
2. He lacks knowledge on how to address issues relating to organic farming. 

So through this project, the farmer is able to maintain a smart farm monitored by IoT sensors, where the values are stored in the blockchain
and problems faced by the farmer are addressed by the experts of the community.
Once the crop is ready for harvest it is put onto the marketplace where the consumer can buy it and the consumer is provided with a detailed timeline
of the crop.
